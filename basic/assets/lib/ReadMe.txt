lib	third-party libraries (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap)

Server-side scripts that do not produce output. Libraries, classes, etc.

Organize libraries and plugins: Place libraries and plugins in a lib directory, and within it, 
create subdirectories for each library (e.g., bootstrap, jquery, font-awesome). 
This keeps related files together and makes it easier to manage dependencies.

 Libraries can have js/css/images
